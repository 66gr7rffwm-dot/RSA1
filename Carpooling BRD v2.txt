1. Executive Summary
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for a formal car pooling platform tailored for Pakistan, addressing rising fuel costs, traffic congestion, and informal carpooling inefficiencies. The platform enables cost sharing, trust through KYC, AI-driven route optimization, and transparency in pricing.
Business Need: 
	•	High fuel and transportation costs 
	•	Traffic congestion in major cities (Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi) 
	•	Lack of verified pooling options for commuters
Solution Overview: 
	•	Mobile apps for iOS and Android 
	•	KYC-verified drivers and registered vehicles 
	•	AI-based route optimization and cost calculation 
	•	Monthly subscription model (500 PKR) 
	•	Max 3 passengers per ride with partial journey support
Benefits:
	•	Reduce commuting costs 
	•	Optimize vehicle usage 
	•	Increase commuter safety and trust 
	•	Improve route efficiency and punctuality

2. Business Context & Market Analysis
Current State: 
	•	Informal carpooling through WhatsApp/Facebook groups lacks verification and reliability. 
	•	Commuters face uncertainty in cost, safety, and punctuality.
Market Opportunity: 
	•	Large urban populations in Pakistan rely on daily commute. 
	•	Fuel prices averaging 250 PKR/liter create high monthly expenses. 
	•	Estimated potential user base: 200,000+ daily commuters.
Regulatory Context:
	•	Government regulations require vehicle verification and CNIC for ridesharing.
	•	Compliance with provincial transport and token tax requirements.

3. Stakeholders & User Personas
Drivers: 
	•	Verified through KYC 
	•	Offer rides for fixed or semi-fixed commutes 
	•	Track earnings, ratings, and schedules
Passengers: 
	•	Book rides along existing routes 
	•	Pay proportionally for distance traveled 
	•	Rate drivers and provide feedback
Admin: 
	•	Manages driver and passenger registrations 
	•	Approves KYC, handles disputes 
	•	Monitors platform metrics and analytics

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 User Registration & Authentication
	•	Mobile number/email signup
	•	OTP verification
	•	Secure password management
	•	Role selection: Driver/Passenger
	•	Account recovery options
4.2 Driver KYC & Verification
	•	Upload CNIC, driving license, vehicle registration, token tax
	•	Selfie verification for identity matching
	•	Admin approval workflow with status tracking (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
	•	Notifications for approval/rejection
4.3 Vehicle Management
	•	Add/edit multiple vehicles per driver
	•	Provide vehicle details (make, model, year, fuel type, seating capacity)
	•	Upload vehicle images
	•	Maintenance records (optional for future phases)
4.4 Route & Trip Management
	•	Define usual commute routes and time windows
	•	Add intermediate pickup/drop points
	•	Configure recurring trips
	•	Set maximum seats per trip
	•	Edit and cancel trips
4.5 Booking Flow
	•	Passengers search for routes and available seats
	•	Select pickup/drop-off points
	•	Display real-time cost based on AI-calculated distance
	•	Confirm bookings and send notifications to drivers
	•	Partial journey handling with cost proportionality
4.6 Subscription Model
	•	Fixed monthly subscription of 500 PKR
	•	Required for both drivers and passengers
	•	No per-ride commission
	•	Subscription auto-renewal and management in app
4.7 Pricing Mechanism (Formula-Based)
Core Principle
The platform operates strictly on cost sharing, not profit. Pricing is computed algorithmically using distance, vehicle type, and occupancy.
	•	Base Trip Cost Formula
	•	
	•	Where:
	•	Distance = AI-calculated route distance
	•	FuelRatePerKm = System-configured (fuel price based)
	•	VehicleFactor = Adjustment for vehicle type
	•	Partial Distance Factor
	•	
	•	Driver Contribution Logic
	•	If 1 passenger only:
	•	
	•	DriverShareFactor = 0.5
	•	Example: TotalTripCost = 500 PKR → DriverContribution = 500 × 0.5 = 250 PKR
	•	Passenger pays remaining 250 PKR
	•	(Example DriverShareFactor = 0.5)
	•	If 2 or 3 passengers:
	•	
	•	All passengers share the cost equally
	•	Driver does not pay any portion
	•	Passenger Cost Formula
	•	
	•	Where:
	•	N = Number of passengers (max 3)
	•	Example 1 – Full Route (G13 → Blue Area)
	•	Distance = 20 km
	•	FuelRatePerKm = 25 PKR
	•	VehicleFactor = 1.0
	•	
	•	2 passengers
	•	Each passenger pays 250 PKR
	•	Driver pays 0 PKR
	•	Example 2 – Single Passenger
	•	TotalTripCost = 500 PKR
	•	DriverShareFactor = 0.5
	•	
	•	Passenger pays 250 PKR
	•	Driver pays 250 PKR
	•	Example 3 – Partial Route (G13 → G9, 10 km)
	•	Total route = 20 km
	•	Passenger travels = 10 km
	•	PartialDistanceFactor = 10 / 20 = 0.5
	•	TotalTripCost = 500 PKR
	•	DriverContribution (single passenger) = 500 × 0.5 = 250 PKR
	•	Passenger pays = (TotalTripCost - DriverContribution) × PartialDistanceFactor = (500 - 250) × 0.5 = 125 PKR
	•	Driver pays = DriverContribution + remaining trip portion = 250 + (TotalTripCost - DriverContribution) × (1 - PartialDistanceFactor) = 250 + 125 = 375 PKR
4.8 AI-Based Navigation & Route Optimization
